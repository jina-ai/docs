Overview
--------

A sparse matrix is a special case of a matrix in which the number of zero elements is much higher than the number of non-zero elements.
The space used for representing data and the time for scanning the matrix can be reduced significantly using a sparse representation.
In this guideline, we'll introduce how to use sparse matrix in Jina.

Before you start
----------------

Before you begin, make sure you meet these prerequisites:

-  Make sure you have basic understanding on Jina.
-  Make sure you have basic understanding on sparse matrices.

.. Note::
    This is an experimental feature, more notes to be added.

Step-by-step guide
------------------

Step 1: Prepare your sparse data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Blah blah blah

Step 2: Make use of Jina Primitive Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

2. Sub-step B
3. Sub-step C

Step 3: Create/Reuse a Sparse Encoder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lead-in sentence explaining the code snippet. For example:

Run the ``apt`` command to install the Asciidoctor package and check the
version.

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo apt install asciidoctor

    $ asciidoctor --version
    Asciidoctor 1.5.6.2 [https://asciidoctor.org]

Step 4: Create/Reuse a Sparse Indexer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provide a summary of the steps completed and explain what the user has
achieved by following them. You can also include links to related
articles that may help the reader reinforce concepts discussed in this
How To article.

Step 4: Build your Sparse Index & Search FLow
