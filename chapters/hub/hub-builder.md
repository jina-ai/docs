# Jina Hub Builder

Jinaâ€™s hub-builder is a simple interface for building & validating Jina Hub Executors. It is built on top of Jina Hub interface. It can be used as a GitHub action in the CI/CD workflow, or via CLI.

## Github action usage:
You can use the `hub builder` as a part of the CI pipeline, to build and test images in the Pull Request. The following YAML can be directly used in the workflow `.github/workflows/hub-builder.yml`.
```
name: Hub Builder

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  hub-builder:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Jina Hub Image Builder
        uses: jina-ai/hub-builder@master
```
On every new PR, the builder finds modifications in `manifest.yml` recursively and tries to build a Hub image using the latest files. That means, when you update an image, you must change `manifest.yml` to trigger the build, i.e. you can simply bump the version field in `manifest.yml`. This is done one by one for each modified Executor.

### Hub builder action accepts the following parameters:
1. `push` (boolean): if push to Docker Hub and MongoDB
2. `dockerhub_username` and `dockerhub_password`: username and password of Docker registry
3. `dockerhub_registry`: URL to the registry
4. `slack_webhook`: webhook for Slack notification
5. `jina_version`: version of Jina for building Hub image
 
Note: the input argument `jina_version` can be different from the version of Jina for running the Pod in the container. The latter should be set in your `_jina_pod/requirements.txt`. The `jina_version` is the version of Jina when building the Pod image.

### Output of the Action
There are two outputs you can use in the post-action:
1. `success_targets`: Successfully built targets with their paths
2. `failed_targets`: Failed built targets with their paths
