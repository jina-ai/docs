A guide on Jina Primitive Data Types
=======================================

A primitive data type is a data type for which the programming language provides built-in support.
For example, when writing a Numpy or Tensorflow program, uses perform matrix manipulation on mutl-dimensional
arrays, such as ``np.ndarray`` or ``tensor``.

Jina introduced the new ``jina.types`` module since ``v0.8``.
Primitive data types complete Jinaâ€™s design by clarifying the low-level data representation in Jina, yielding a much simpler, safer, and faster interface on the high-level.
More importantly, they ensure the universality and extensibility for Jina in the long-term.
