# Build your first Jina app

## üëã Introduction

This tutorial guides you through building your own neural search app using the [Jina framework](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/). 

![](/chapters/images/jinabox-wikipedia.gif)

Our example program will be a simple neural search engine for text. It will take a user's input and return a list of sentences from Wikipedia that match most closely.

The end result will be close to [Wikipedia sentence search](https://github.com/jina-ai/examples/tree/master/wikipedia-sentences).

## üóùÔ∏è Key concepts

You should be familiar with these before you start:

- **[What is Neural Search?](https://jina.ai/2020/07/06/What-is-Neural-Search-and-Why-Should-I-Care.html)** See how Jina is different from traditional search
- **[Jina 101](https://docs.jina.ai/chapters/101/)**: Learn about Jina's core components
- **[Jina 102](https://docs.jina.ai/chapters/102/)**: See how Jina's components are connected together

## üê≥ Try it in Docker

Before building your app, let's see what the finished product is like:

```sh
docker run --name wikipedia-search -p 45678:45678 jinahub/app.example.wikipedia-sentences-30k:0.2.9-1.0.1
```

This runs a **pre-indexed** version of the example, and allows you to search using Jina's REST API.

‚ÑπÔ∏è  Run the Docker image before trying the steps below

### Search with Jina Box

[Jina Box](https://github.com/jina-ai/jinabox.js/) is a simple web-based front-end for neural search. You can see it in the image at the top of this tutorial.

1. Go to [Jina Box](https://jina.ai/jinabox.js) in your browser
2. Set the server endpoint to `http://127.0.0.1:45678/api/search`
3. Type a word into the search bar and see which Wikipedia sentences come up

‚ÑπÔ∏è  If the search times out the first time, that's because the query system is still warming up. Try again in a few seconds!

### Search with `curl`

```sh
curl --request POST -d '{"top_k":10,"mode":"search","data":["computer"]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 'http://0.0.0.0:45678/api/search'
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è  To make it easier to read the output, add `| jq | less` to the end of the command. This will add pretty JSON formatting and paging.

`curl` will output a *lot* of information in JSON format. This includes not just the lines you're searching for, but also metadata about the search and the Documents it returns. 

After looking through the JSON you should see lines that contain the text of the Document matches:

```json
"text": "It solves Aerospace problems with a data driven interface and automatic initial guesses.\n"
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è  There's a LOT of other data too. This is all metadata and not so relevant to the output a user would want to see.
‚ÑπÔ∏è  If you're not getting good results, check the [get better search results section](#get-better-search-results) below.

### Shut down Docker

To cleanly exit the Docker container, open a new terminal window and run:

```sh
docker stop wikipedia-search
```

## üêç Build the app

### Prerequisites

* Linux or macOS (or see [instructions to install Jina on Windows](https://docs.jina.ai/chapters/install/os/via-pip.html#on-windows))
* Python 3.7 or higher, and `pip`
* 8 gigabytes or more of RAM

### Create a virtualenv and install Jina

A virtualenv ensures your system libraries and project libraries don't conflict or interfere with each other.

```sh
mkdir my_jina_app
cd my_jina_app
virtualenv env
source /env/bin/activate
```

Now install Jina in this clean environment:

```sh
pip install jina[hub]==1.0
```

Above we only specify to install [Jina Hub](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina-hub). This is because Hub contains the wizard to create a new Jina app.

### Create a new app

```sh
jina hub new --type=app
```

We recommend the following settings:

| Parameter                   | What to type                                          |
| ---                         | ---                                                   |
| `project_name`              | `Wikipedia sentence search`                           |
| `jina_version`              | Use default setting                                   |
| `project_slug`              | Use default setting                                   |
| `author_name`               | Your name                                             |
| `project_short_description` | `Search Wikipedia sentences using Jina neural search` |
| `task_type`                 | `2` (NLP)                                             |
| `index_type`                | `2` (strings)                                         |
| `public_port`               | Use default setting                                   |
| `parallel`                  | Use default setting                                   |
| `shards`                    | Use default setting                                   |
| `version`                   | Use default setting                                   |

After you have answered all the questions, the wizard will create [a folder and files](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A2t-K2DEZvJ7sOmWLuCmUQINyESaxucM7wOJCSCPmdI/edit#) for your new Jina app.

### Install app requirements

In the terminal:

```sh
cd wikipedia_sentence_search
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download data (optional)

Our goal is to search a set of sentences from Wikipedia and return the closest sentences to our search term. We use [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mikeortman/wikipedia-sentences) from Kaggle.

By default we just include a [subset of this data](/data/toy-input.txt), so you don't need to download anything. However, if you'd like to work with more sentences:

1. Set up [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api#getting-started-installation-&-authentication)
2. `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jina-ai/examples/master/wikipedia-sentences/get_data.sh`
3. `sh ./get_data.sh`

The `get_data.sh` script:

- Creates a data directory
- Downloads the dataset from Kaggle
- Extracts and shuffles the dataset to ensure variety in what we ask Jina to search

Since `app.py` indexes `data/toy-input.txt` by default, we override it with an environment variable

```sh
export JINA_DATA_FILE='data/input.txt'
```

Double check it was set successfully by running:

```sh
echo $JINA_DATA_FILE
```

## üèÉ Run the app

In section you will index and search through your data.

### Index Flow

First up we need to build up an index of our dataset, which we'll later search with our [query Flow](#query-flow).

```sh
python app.py -t index
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è  `-t` is short for `--task`

You'll see a lot of output scrolling by. Indexing is complete when you see:

```sh
Flow@58199[S]:flow is closed and all resources should be released already, current build level is EMPTY
```

This may take longer the first time, because Jina needs to download the language model and tokenizer to process the dataset. You can think of these as the brains that power the search.

### Query Flow

Run:

```bash
python app.py -t query_restful
```

After a while you should see the console stop scrolling and display output like:

```console
        üñ•Ô∏è Local access         http://0.0.0.045678
        üîí Private network:     http://192.168.1.68:45678
        üåê Public address:      http://81.37.167.157:45678
```

Your search engine is now ready to run!

‚ö†Ô∏è  Note down the port number. You'll need it for `curl` and the Jina Box front-end. In our case we can see it's `45678`.

‚ÑπÔ∏è  `python app.py -t query_restful` doesn't pop up a search interface - for that you'll need to connect via `curl`, Jina Box, or another client. Alternatively run `python app.py -t query` to search from your terminal.

### Searching Wikipedia sentences

See our section on [searching the data](#search-the-data).

When you're finished, stop the Flow with Ctrl-C (or Command-C on a Mac), and run `deactivate` to exit your virtualenv. (If you wish to re-activate it in the future, you can return to the app directory and run `source env/bin/activate`).

## ü§î How does it work?

### Flows

<img src="https://docs.jina.ai/_images/flow.png" width="30%" align="left">

Just as a plant manages nutrient flow and growth rate for its branches, Jina's Flow manages the states and context of a group of Pods, orchestrating them to accomplish one specific task. 

We define Flows in `app.py` to index and query our dataset:

```python
from jina.flow import Flow

<other code here>

def index():
    f = Flow.load_config('flows/index.yml')

    with f:
        data_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), os.environ.get('JINA_DATA_FILE', None)) # Set data path
        f.index_lines(filepath=data_path, batch_size=16, read_mode='r', size=num_docs) # Set mode (index_lines) and indexing settings
```

To start the Flow, we run `python app.py -t <flow_name>`, in this case:

```sh
python app.py -t index
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è  You also can build Flows in `app.py` itself [without specifying them in YAML](https://docs.jina.ai/chapters/flow/index.html) or with [Jina Dashboard](http://dashboard.jina.ai)

#### Indexing

`input.txt` is just one big text file. Our indexing Flow will create an index of each line in the file, and later Jina will query this index. The indexing is performed by the Pods in the Flow. Each Pod performs a different task, with one Pod's output becoming another Pod's input. 

Every Flow is defined in its own YAML file. Let's look at `flows/index.yml`:

```yaml
!Flow
version: '1'
pods:
  - name: encoder
    uses: pods/encode.yml
    timeout_ready: 1200000
    read_only: true
  - name: indexer
    uses: pods/index.yml
```

Each Pod performs a different operation on the dataset:

| Pod       | Task                                                       |
| ---       | ---                                                        |
| `crafter` | Split Documents into sentences                             |
| `encoder` | Encode each input Document into a vector                   |
| `indexer` | Build an index of the vectors and metadata key-value pairs |

#### Searching

Like the index Flow, the search Flow is also defined in a YAML file, in this case at `flows/query.yml`:

```yaml
!Flow
version: '1'
with:
  read_only: true
  port_expose: $JINA_PORT
pods:
  - name: encoder
    uses: pods/encode.yml
    timeout_ready: 60000
    read_only: true
  - name: indexer
    uses: pods/index.yml
```

As in `flows/index.yml`, we use three Pods, but this time they behave differently:

| Pod       | Task                                                              |
| ---       | ---                                                               |
| `crafter` | Split input query into sentences                                  |
| `encoder` | Encode user's query into a vector                                 |
| `indexer` | Query vector index and key-value pairs; Return matching Documents |

### Pods

<img src="https://docs.jina.ai/_images/pod.png" width="20%" align="left">

- A Flow tells Jina *what* tasks (indexing, querying) to perform on the dataset.
- The [Pods]() comprise the Flow and tell Jina *how* to perform each task. They define the neural networks we use in neural search, namely the machine-learning models like `distilbert-base-cased`.

Like Flows, Jina defines Pods in their own YAML files. We can easily configure their behavior without touching our application code.

Let's look at [`pods/encode.yml`](pods/encode.yml) as an example:

```yaml
!TransformerTorchEncoder
with:
  pooling_strategy: auto
  pretrained_model_name_or_path: distilbert-base-cased
  max_length: 96
```

- The built-in `TransformerTorchEncoder` is the Pod's **[Executor](https://docs.jina.ai/chapters/101.html#executor)**. 
- The `with` field specifies the parameters we pass to `TransformerTorchEncoder`:

| Parameter                       | Effect                                                     |
| ---                             | ---                                                        |
| `pooling_strategy`              | Strategy to merge word embeddings into Document embeddings |
| `pretrained_model_name_or_path` | Name of the model we're using                              |
| `max_length`                    | Maximum length to truncate tokenized sequences to          |

All the other Pods follow a similar structure.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è  Next steps

### Get better search results

Your results may not be very suitable when you query your dataset. This can be fixed in several ways:

#### Index more Documents

[Download the larger dataset](#download-data-optional), and increase `JINA_MAX_DOCS` to index more sentences. This gives the language model more data to work with: 

```sh
export JINA_MAX_DOCS=30000
```

#### Increase `max_length`

In `pods/encode.yml` increase the length of your embeddings:

```yaml
with:
  ...
  max_length: 192 # This works better for our Wikipedia dataset
```

#### Change language model

Language model performance depends on your task. If you're indexing Chinese sentences, you wouldn't use an English-language model! Jina default model for text search is [`distilbert-base-cased`](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-cased). [Other models](https://huggingface.co/models) may work better depending on your dataset and use case.

In `pods/encode.yml`:

```yaml
with:
  ...
  pretrained_model_name_or_path: <your model name>
```

### Simplify the code

The `crafter` Pod splits each Document in our input file into seperate sentences. Our Documents are already in sentences anyway, so this Pod is redundant. Let's remove it:

```sh
rm -f pods/craft.yml
```

Also remove those Pod entries from `flows/index.yml` and `flows/query.yml`.

### Enable [incremental indexing](https://docs.jina.ai/chapters/incremental_indexing/index.html)

In this example, if you wanted to index more data you would need to remove your `workspace` directory and then re-index **everything** from scratch. To avoid this [we can add incremental indexing](https://github.com/jina-ai/examples/tree/master/wikipedia-sentences-incremental)

## ü§ï Troubleshooting

### Module not found error

- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Ensure you have enough RAM/swap and space in your `tmp` partition (see below issues)

### My computer hangs

Machine learning requires a lot of resources. If your computer hangs this may be because it's run out of memory. To fix this, try [creating a swap file](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-20-04/) if you use Linux. This is less of an issue on macOS, since it allocates swap automatically.
