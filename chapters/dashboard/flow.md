## Flow Design GUI

##### Our GUI is a visual interface that makes composing flows as easy as browsing Facebook. Design, configure and deploy your flows right from the browser!

### Features

-  Build your own custom Flows per Drag & Drop on the canvas leveraging templates, YAML files or by starting from scratch with empty pods and flows.
-  Deploy your flow with one click directly through JinaD
-  Export your flow as YAML or PNG
