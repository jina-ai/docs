Motivation
^^^^^^^^^^^

As you might already learned from `Jina 101 <https://101.jina.ai>`_,
a :term:`Driver` interprets incoming messages into :term:`Document` and extracts required fields for an :term:`Executor`.

Jina already created `72 drivers <https://docs.jina.ai/chapters/all_driver/>`_ drivers inside Core,
and these `Drivers` should already fulfill most of the scenarios.
While if you're creating a customised `Executor`,
and you find the current `Drivers` is not fit for your `Executor`,
you might want to create a customised `Driver`.
