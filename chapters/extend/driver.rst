.. note:: This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Jina, if you haven't, please check out `Jina 101 <https://101.jina.ai>`_ first.
.. warning:: This is an advanced developer guide. The existing Drivers should cover most use cases. If you add custom Drivers, the Jina community may not be able to provide you with development support.

Motivation
^^^^^^^^^^^

As you might have already learned from `Jina 101 <https://101.jina.ai>`_,
a :term:`Driver` interprets incoming messages into :term:`Document` and extracts required fields for an :term:`Executor`.

Jina already created `several Drivers <https://docs.jina.ai/chapters/all_driver/>`_ inside Core,
and these `Drivers` should already fulfill most of the scenarios.
However, when the existing solutions do not fit your specific use case,
you might be curious how to **extend** Jina.
For instance, if you have created a customized `Executor`,
and figure out the existent `Drivers` can not fit for your customized `Executor`,
you might want to create a customized `Driver`.

Overview
^^^^^^^^^

There are two steps to adding an extension of a Jina `Driver`:

1. Decide which `Driver` class to inherit from.
2. Overwrite the **Core** method of the `Driver`.

Implementation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to create a customized `Executor` and it's associated `Driver`,
follow the table below to decide which `BaseDriver` class to inherit from.
After creating your customized `Driver` class, you need to implement your own Core method based on your specific need.

     - `extract`


Customize Driver in Action: `MultimodalDriver`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We created `MultimodalDriver <https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/blob/master/jina/drivers/multimodal.py>`_ to better support Cross/Multi-modal search.
Assume a `Document` has 2 child `Documents` with different modalities, e.g. text and image.
The objective of `MultimodalDriver` is to extract embeddings from both modalities.
Our expected input and output can be represented as:

.. highlight:: shell
.. code-block:: shell

    Input:
    document:
            |- child document: {modality: mode1}
            |
            |- child document: {modality: mode2}
    Output:
    document: (embedding: multimodal encoding)
            |- child document: {modality: mode1}
            |
            |- child document: {modality: mode2}


In the code snippet below, you should be able to see the logic of how we implemented the Driver.
In :meth:`_apply_all`,
We firstly convert each Document in the `DocumentSet` into a `MultimediaDocument`.
For each instance of the `MultimediaDocument`,
we check if the instance has :meth:`modality_content_map` (a python `dict`, where key is the name of the modality, while value is the content of the modality).
If so, we consider it has a valid `MultimediaDocument`.
And we save the value of the specific Modality into `content_by_modality`.
The result will be feed into :meth:`exec_fn` as the input.

Since class `MultiModalDriver` is based on `BaseEncodeDriver`, the :meth:`exec_fn` will be bind to the :meth:`encode` method,
to encode data from different modalities into embeddings.
Last but not least, we assign the `embeddings` property of each Document as the encoded vector representation.
And the task of the Driver finished.

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python


    class MultiModalDriver(FlatRecursiveMixin, BaseEncodeDriver):
    """Extract multimodal embeddings from different modalities."""

        ...

        def _apply_all(self, docs: 'DocumentSet', *args, **kwargs) -> None:
            """Apply the driver to each of the Documents in docs."""
            content_by_modality = defaultdict(
                list
            )

            valid_docs = []
            for doc in docs:
                doc = MultimodalDocument(doc)
                if doc.modality_content_map:
                    valid_docs.append(doc)
                    for modality in self.positional_modality:
                        content_by_modality[modality].append(doc[modality])

            if valid_docs:
                for modality in self.positional_modality:
                    content_by_modality[modality] = np.stack(content_by_modality[modality])

                input_args = self._get_executor_input_arguments(content_by_modality)
                embeds = self.exec_fn(*input_args)
                for doc, embedding in zip(valid_docs, embeds):
                    doc.embedding = embedding
