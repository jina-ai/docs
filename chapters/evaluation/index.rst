Motivation
--------------------

In Jina, just like in any search system, it's critical to measure system performance.

Generally, evaluation is about computing the difference between an output and ideal results,
users generally place an emphasis on evaluating final document ranking results using information retrieval metrics,
such as Precision, Recall, mAP or nDCG.
However, it ignores the fact that a search system is often composed of multiple components,
whereas evaluation on the final results hardly reveals useful insights about the system. Jina allows the user
to evaluate any part of the system using arbitrary metrics.


Before you start
-------------------

We expect you have a clean Python 3.7/3.8/3.9 (virtual) environment.
Install Jina on your machine:

.. highlight:: bash
.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U jina


Overview
-----------------

To achieve our objective, Jina has a family of :term:`Executor` named :term:`Evaluator`.
These Evaluators capture and evaluate Documents from any part of the Flow.

As a new type of :term:`Executor`, Evaluators inspect Documents from the request and compare them with GroundTruth.
The Executor can be wrapped in a :term:`Pod` and placed anywhere in the :term:`Flow`.
They tend to be placed after the :term:`Pod` applying the transformation that wants to be evaluated by the specific `Evaluator`.

In order to be able to Evaluate the performance of a transformation applied to a Document by any part of a Jina
:term:`Flow`, we need to know what the desired state of the :term:`Document` is. This desired state is called
:term:`GroundTruth` and can be passed in Jina in every ``IndexRequest`` and ``SearchRequest``. This :term:`GroundTruth`
in Jina is nothing else than another :term:`Document`.

``IndexRequest`` and ``SearchRequest`` are formed by streams of pairs and `Documents` and `GroundTruths`. When no evaluation
is involved, `GroundTruth` tends to be empty, however when an `Evaluation` pod is involved in the Flow, it will actually
take the information of every `GroundTruth` to feed both `Document` and `GroundTruth` information to the Evaluator :term:`Executor`

Evaluation consists of extraction and evaluation.
In Jina, a :term:`Driver` extracts Document and GroundTruth information from a :term:`Protobuf` message,
and passes this information to the Executor.
The second steps happens inside the Executor: evaluate the difference between these two documents into a score.
Afterwards, the :term:`Driver` will add the results of the evaluation into the `evaluations` field of the `Document`.


Since Evaluation tends to focus only on some small parts of the `Documents` (IDs of the matches when evaluating Rankers,
embedding when evaluating Encoders),
GroundTruth does not need to contain more information from the Document than will be used by the Evaluator.

It is important to note that the Documents inside the `IndexRequest` and `SerchRequest` are transformed by the `Drivers`
inside the Flow while GroundTruth never changes, since is only used to analyze and compare to its paired `Document`
at any point of the Flow.

Currently, Evaluators can be categorised into **ranking Evaluator**, **text Evaluator** and **embedding Evaluator**,
but these can be extended to evaluate any kind of information inside a Document.

     - Evaluates the difference between actual and desired embeddings


Evaluation in action
----------------------

Evaluation works in parallel with ``IndexRequest`` and ``SearchRequest``.

While `Evaluation` :term:`Pods` can be added at arbitrary points of the Flow like any other Pods,
the Flow API :meth:`inspect` allows users to add pods with close to zero-overhead with the rest of the Flow.

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

    from jina import Flow

    f = Flow(inspect='HANG').add(
        uses='!BaseCrafter', name='crafter').add(
        uses='!BaseEncoder', name='encoder').inspect(
        uses='!BaseEmbeddingEvaluator', name='embed_eval').add(
        uses='!CompoundIndexer', name='indexer').add(
        uses='!BaseRanker', name='ranker').inspect(
        uses='!BaseRankingEvaluator', name='rank_eval')

.. image:: hang.svg

The above example shows how the evaluation Pods are introduced using :meth:`inspect` without introducing any side-effect to the Flow.

1. The evaluations are running as *side task* in parallel. They deviate from the main task and are not required to complete the request. Thus, it wonâ€™t slow down the Flow on the main task.
2. Attaching an inspect Pod to the Flow does not change the socket type between the original Pod and its neighbours.
3. All inspect Pods can be removed from the Flow by setting ``Flow(inspect='REMOVE')``.

You might noticed that we defined ``Flow(inspect='HANG')`` in the above code example as inspect type.
The :class:`FlowInspectType` has three types: ``HANG``, ``COLLECT`` and ``REMOVE``.
The differences are shown in the figures below:

``Flow(inspect='HANG')``

``Flow(inspect='COLLECT')``

.. image:: collect.svg

``Flow(inspect='REMOVE')``

Conclusion
-----------------

In this guide, we introduced why we need Jina Evaluators,
how we organize Jina Evaluators.
Apart from that, we gave some concrete examples of how to use Jina Evaluators.
