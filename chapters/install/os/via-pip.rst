Install Jina Core via ``pip``
=================================

``pip`` is a package-management system written in Python used to install and manage software packages. For Python 2.x the command is called ``pip``\ , and for Python >= 3 it is called ``pip3``. In many operating systems ``pip`` is linked to ``pip3``. Run the command ``pip --version`` to check the Python version that is in use, actually.

If you prefer to run Jina natively on your host, please make sure you have Python >= 3.7 installed.

Install from PyPi
-----------------

On Linux/Mac, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install jina

.. note:: Currently we do not support native Python on Windows. If you are a Windows user, one workaround is to `run Jina on Windows Subsystem for Linux <../on-wsl>`_ or `run Jina in a Docker container <../via-docker>`_.

Check the installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After you have installed Jina Core, it is advisable to carry out a short check. This will verify that everything has gone smoothly. On the command line, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   jina -vf

The option `-vf` (long version: `--version-full`) shows Jina and all the dependencies' versions. The output contains a list of Python packages followed by the names of variables that are in use. If an error message is shown, Jina was not installed correctly.



Other OSes
----------

Please refer to `run Jina in a Docker container <../via-docker>`_. If you manage to run Jina on other OSes after some tweaks, please submit your changes `here <https://github.com/jina-ai/jina/issues/new>`_.

Upgrade Jina
============

If you have a previously installed version of Jina, you can upgrade it by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -U jina

For Docker users the following command updates Jina in the Docker container:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker pull jinaai/jina


Install from the master branch
------------------------------

If you want to keep track of the master branch of our development repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/jina-ai/jina.git

Be aware that the master branch may not be stable. We only recommend this branch for testing new features.

Install from your local fork/clone
----------------------------------

If you are a developer and want to test your changes on-the-fly:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/jina
   cd jina && pip install -e .

In the dev mode, if you later switch to a different method of Jina installation, remember to first uninstall the version you edited:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip uninstall $(basename $(find . -name '*.egg-info') .egg-info)

Cherry-pick extra dependencies
------------------------------

Jina requires only five dependencies ``numpy``\ , ``pyzmq``\ , ``protobuf``\ , ``grpcio`` and ``pyyaml``. No third-party pre-trained models, deep learning/NLP/CV packages will be installed.

However, some Executors may require extra dependencies. The full table of these extra dependencies can be found in ``extra-requirements.txt``. You can cherry-pick what you want to install, e.g.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install "jina[nlp+cv]"

This will install all dependencies tagged with ``nlp`` or ``cv``.

Though not recommended, you can install Jina with full dependencies via:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install "jina[all]"

To install cherry-picked dependencies from the master branch
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install "git+https://github.com/jina-ai/jina.git#egg=jina[http]"
