Developer Guides
======================================
Jina developer guides cover specific features and use cases.

Jina Core is the open-source framework of Jina AI. It is a new, state-of-the-art design pattern allowing you to create end-to-end search solutions. It leverages the latest AI and deep learning models out-of-the box and lets you deploy them anywhere you want.

Brand new users to Jina Core should first begin with the :doc:`../introduction/index` section which covers more fundamental concepts.

Further information on any specific method can be obtained in the :doc:`../api_references/index`.
