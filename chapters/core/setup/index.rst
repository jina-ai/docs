Installation
======================================

Jina Core includes the core components of Jina. Without it, neither the Jina Dashboard, nor the Jina Hub or the Jina Box will work.

Setting up Jina Core is not complicated and can be done in just a few steps.

Below you will find the setup guides for various, selected environments.
