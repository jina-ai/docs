Setup
======================================

Jina Core includes the core components of Jina. Without it, neither 
the Jina Dashboard, nor the Jina Hub or the Jina Box will work.

Setting up Jina Core is not complicated and can be done in just a few 
steps. You should plan between one and one and a half hours for this. 
The actual time required and the individual steps depend on the 
environment in which you set up Jina Core.

Below you will find the setup guides for various, selected environments.
