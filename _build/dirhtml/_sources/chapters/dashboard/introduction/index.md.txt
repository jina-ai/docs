# Introduction

**Jina Dashboard** is a low-code monitoring and management environment for Jina. With the Dashboard you can build Jina Flows, manage them from a central location and get insights into the health of the Flow through log stream analysis!

Use the Jina Dashboard [online](https://dashboard.jina.ai) or by cloning the Dashboard code from the corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jina-ai/dashboard). The illustration below gives you a first impression of the Dashboard.

## Features
### [Flow Design GUI:](../flow.md)
Build your own custom Flow visually on the canvas leveraging templates, YAML files or by starting from scratch with empty Pods and Flows. You can add properties as you go, and deploy new and modified Jina components right from the canvas.

### [LogStream](../log-stream.md)
Jina's LogStream enables you to dig deeper into your Jina Flow and debug it by viewing your log messages in real-time. This also covers filtering, grouping and searching based on component (Pod) as well as log level and message.

### [Jina Hub](../hub.md)
Share and discover custom and community driven Jina Pods and Apps tailored to specific use cases of neural search.
